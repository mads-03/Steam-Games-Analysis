# 🎮 Steam Games Revenue Analysis

A data-driven project that analyzes how launch price and user reviews influence the estimated revenue of video games on the Steam platform. Built using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Scikit-learn, and deployed with **Streamlit**.

> 📘 This project was developed by **Team Mehfil** as part of the *Probability and Statistics* course (BSCS, 4B) during Spring 2025.

## 📊 Project Overview

We analyzed a cleaned dataset of 300+ Steam games to:

* Explore trends using **descriptive statistics** and **data visualization**
* Apply **probability distributions** and **log transformations**
* Model relationships using **linear regression**
* Visualize findings via an **interactive Streamlit web app**

## 🚀 How to Run the Project Locally

> Make sure Python 3.8+ is installed.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/steam-games-analysis.git
cd steam-games-analysis
```

### 2. Create & Activate Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
